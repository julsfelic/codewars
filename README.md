# Codewars Solutions Repo

## Description

This repo contains solutions to various exercises found at the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) website.
All solutions at this time are written in Ruby, but will eventually contain solutions
in multiple languages. The ruby solutions contain a both a main application file
and a test file. Each solution is broken into its own directory and test can be
run with the following command:

```bash
$ ruby file_name_test.rb
```

If you would like to contribute to adding solutions in other languages feel free
to make a pull request.
